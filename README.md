# Arduino-CLI

This sketch helps you to debug every I/O pin input or output. So you don't have to program yourself only for testing each pin :)

Beside of that, if your microcontroller support secondary serial then you can use it with `send` and `listen` command.

You can also use this sketch to let PC program handles the logic and transport some commands via COM Serial Port. So you don't have to write every command and its behavior. Easy!

## How to use

1. [Download](https://github.com/Thor-x86/arduino_cli/archive/master.zip) (or clone) this repo
2. [Install Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

4. Make sure the IDE is configured based on Microcontroller that you'll use
5. Click ‚û°
6. Wait until finish, then click üîç (Serial Monitor)
7. Now it's ready to be operated, type `help` then hit enter to see available commands
